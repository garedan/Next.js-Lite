### Next.js-Lite

A light version of Next.js, without using create-next-app. Dependencies install fast and includes a basic movie search engine (credits to https://github.com/GreyStone97/React_Movie_Search_App), to have some content. Includes Tailwind CSS.

I'm testing if it's possible to make any Next application with this version.
